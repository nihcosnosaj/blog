      <h1>About the Blog</h1>
      <p>
         Much like traditional pubs of the swashbuckling 17th century, Ye Olde Bloggery is a place where ideas are lofted into the air to a nearly non-existent audience.
         Originally born as simple practice to improve my Python and Django skills, Ye Olde Bloggery has quickly become a 
         pet project of mine where I can not only develop my technical knowledge of Python and Django, but explore some of my other passions 
         in life, such as music, film, language, and technology.
